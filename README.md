This Hotel Reservation System is a Java-based console application that uses JDBC to interact with a MySQL database for managing hotel bookings. It allows users to retrieve guest information, allocate rooms, view room occupancy details, and perform guest checkout operations through a simple menu-driven interface. The system connects to a MySQL database (hotel_db) and performs secure database operations using PreparedStatements, ensuring data integrity and protection against SQL injection. This project demonstrates core concepts of Java, database connectivity, and basic CRUD operations, making it suitable for learning and academic purposes
